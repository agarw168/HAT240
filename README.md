If you don't have permission to run the .sh file, run the followng command:

chmod +x auto_run_test.sh

For my Windows friends, the following command will fix this script
after you save your changes. Windows likes to use different line
endings, so this will change them to allow for proper compilation:

sed -i -e 's/\r$//' auto_run_test.sh
